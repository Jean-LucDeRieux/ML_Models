# Machine Learning Models
Welcome to Machine Learning Models repository! This repository is dedicated to the demonstration the most common machine learning algorithms from scratch for acedmic growth in the field of machine learning.


# Dataset required #
MNIST Handwritten 0-9 numbers: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv

# Useful commands
- Installing all required packages: `pip install cv2 && pip install numpy && pip install pandas && pip install matplotlib`
    - This installs cv2, numpy, pandas, and matplotlib

# Good Resources #
- Types of Neural Networks: https://towardsai.net/p/machine-learning/main-types-of-neural-networks-and-its-applications-tutorial-734480d7ec8e
- Great example of basics of nerual network: https://youtu.be/8d6jf7s6_Qs?si=fhk-a2IxZOXOmzbA


# Misc
- This repository uses conventional commits: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary
    - feat: – a new feature is introduced with the changes
    - fix: – a bug fix has occurred
    - chore: – changes that do not relate to a fix or feature and don't modify src or test files (for example updating dependencies)
    - refactor: – refactored code that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
    - docs: – updates to documentation such as a the README or other markdown files
    - style: – changes that do not affect the meaning of the code, likely related to code formatting such as white-space, missing semi-colons, and so on.
    - test: – including new or correcting previous tests
    - perf: – performance improvements
    - ci: – continuous integration related
    - build: – changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
    - revert: – reverts a previous commit
